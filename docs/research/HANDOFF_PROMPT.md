You are continuing the REL301m Adaptive Preference MORL research project.

Before acting:
1. Read `AGENTS.md`, `.agents/memory/MEMORY.md`, and `docs/research/PROJECT_STATUS.md`.
2. Run `python scripts/research_harness.py doctor` and `python scripts/research_harness.py status`.
3. Run `git status --short --branch`; do not overwrite unrelated changes.
4. Read the relevant protocol/config/code directly before making scientific claims.

Current phase: phase-4 — Paired-seed course experiment matrix (active)
Publication state: no multi-seed empirical claim established

Roadmap:
- phase-0 [complete]: Foundation and scientific repair
- phase-1 [complete]: Claim and antecedent mapping
- phase-2 [complete]: Pilot calibration and protocol freeze
- phase-3 [complete]: Mechanism diagnostics
- phase-4 [active]: Paired-seed course experiment matrix
- phase-5 [not_started]: Course paper
- phase-6 [not_started]: Workshop and journal extension
- phase-7 [not_started]: Submission and artifact freeze

Research question:
Under matched interaction, update, evaluation, and tuning budgets, which signal—conditioning gap, masked-ensemble disagreement, local coverage and recency, or observed learning progress—best predicts and improves future performance in weak preference regions?

Source precedence:
1. Executed tests and versioned raw-result artifacts.
2. Code and protocol/config files.
3. Machine-readable registries under `research/`, `docs/research/PROJECT_STATUS.md`, and `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.
4. Editable proposal v2.
5. Other Markdown documents.
6. Original submitted proposal PDF (historical only).

Active claims:
- conditioning-gap-allocation [implemented]: Empirical conditioning gap identifies weak preference regions
- disagreement-allocation [implemented]: Masked-ensemble disagreement identifies useful allocation regions
- coverage-recency-allocation [implemented]: Local coverage and recency improve preference allocation
- learning-progress-allocation [hypothesis]: Observed learning progress is a better allocation target than difficulty or uncertainty
- combined-allocation [hypothesis]: Combining gap, disagreement, coverage/recency, and progress improves sample efficiency
- environment-shift-robustness [hypothesis]: Adaptive preference allocation affects robustness under dynamics shift

Full-text requests for the user:

Active experiments:
- course-paired-matrix [blocked]: Paired-seed controls and allocation-signal ablations
- minecart-pcqn-remediation [failed]: Minecart sparse-credit PCQN backbone qualification
- minecart-pcqn-remediation-v2 [failed]: Minecart prioritized-replay PCQN backbone qualification

Open blockers:
- Minecart v2 failed the frozen all-seeds qualification with zero ore at all 30 checkpoints. Authorization aris-full-workflow-20261017 now permits a separately versioned F1 successful-episode replay scope/protocol amendment, implementation, deterministic qualification, and six paired local training/nominal-validation runs. F2, matrix v1, checkpoint locking, revised course execution, and final test remain blocked until the declared F1 all-seeds retention and source-audit gate passes and the relevant explicit unlock is recorded.

Latest closed-session summary:
Ran a bounded ARIS offline continuation with fresh quota/preflight. Reused existing literature and Minecart evidence, produced a corrected successful-episode-stratified HPR-style proposal, completed three traced same-family review rounds ending at 9.10 READY/provisional, wrote a blocked 6+6 staged experiment plan/tracker and narrative HTML, and persisted the ARIS run at idea-discovery provisional. No implementation, training, rollout, final test, paid review, commit, push, or submission occurred.

Next actions:
1. Commit and publish the versioned ARIS authority/policy update as a stacked review PR based on feature/ai-research-harness.
2. Implement and deterministically qualify the F1 successful-episode replay amendment, obtain same-family code/scientific review, then run only the six authorized paired local training and nominal-validation jobs with fresh preflight evidence.
3. Keep F2, matrix v1, checkpoint locking, final test, paid review, unattended dispatch, and submission blocked until their separately documented gates pass.

Non-negotiable scientific guardrails:
- Do not label a claim `experimentally_supported` without a versioned raw-result artifact.
- Do not use final-test data for tuning, normalization, reference points, or checkpoint selection.
- Separate preference generalization from environment/dynamics generalization.
- Match interaction, update, diagnostic-evaluation, final-evaluation, and tuning budgets.
- Literature: use primary sources; log queries; register metadata/BibTeX; complete notes; never commit PDFs.
- Search legal full-text alternatives autonomously. If access still fails, keep the paper `screened`, record
  `full_text_required`, state what was tried, and ask the user for an uploaded PDF or authorized link.
- Never make a strong novelty or mechanism claim from metadata or an abstract alone.
- End substantial sessions with `python scripts/research_harness.py session close ... --write-handoff`.
